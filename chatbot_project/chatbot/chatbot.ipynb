            "Chatbot Response: Hi Prattville, I'm sorry is happening you. need support right now, yes, need answers. is denial is trying hide truth, protect herself. is natural behaviour. don't indicate whether wants marriage, is planning leave. way go depends part answer question. wants marriage, certainly right say \"I need answers questions\". Giving information needs (if wants marriage) important protecting herself. would support right advocate information need order feel secure make decisions. may fear truth will turn away. want to, can reassure want marriage matter truth is. marriage is survive, needs openness.If, hand, she's planning end marriage, might want resign fact may never get information seek. better off, case, seeking support friends family rather beating closed door. wife decisions make. Try give bit time make them. can patiently say \"I know thing is happening. Talk can deal together. want move forward need truth.\" time (and good therapist, is willing wants marriage) will tell way one will go. Individually, can seek professional help well.\n"
